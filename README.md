## Getting Started
I've successfully integrated Stripe's card payment system and PayPal payment system into my Flutter application! This integration enables a seamless and secure payment experience for users, enhancing the app's functionality and user satisfaction. 

##💡 Throughout the project, you’ll find:
   ▪️ Effective state management using Cubit
   ▪️ A straightforward approach to dependency injection with Get_it
   ▪️ The use of Dio for handling HTTP requests
   ▪️ A clear implementation of Stripe Payment Intents
   ▪️ Simple integration of the flutter_stripe package
   ▪️ A basic setup of the flutter_paypal_payment package
